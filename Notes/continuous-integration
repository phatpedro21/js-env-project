When a team member commits code, it is important that the code works! and not just on the comitees machine.

We can set up continuous integration to log and monitor code changes.

A CI (continuous integration) server helps catch 'issues' quickly

What does a CI Server do?

    -Runs an automated build when code is commited
    -Can report Who broke the code, and when
    -Runs test suite (incase you forgot)
    -Can check code coverage
    -Can also automate deployment


Examples of CI Servers

-Travis:        Linux based CI server
-Appveyor       Windows based CI server
-Jenkins
-CircleCI
-semaphore
-SnapCI


We are going to set up Travis AND Appveyor to test builds on both linux and windows, which is always a good idea
to ensure issues don't arise when working cross platform.
