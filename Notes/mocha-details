When calling mocha, we need to define a reporter, which will determine how results are displayed
    -There are many different reporters to use, but progress is reccomended

then give it a setup script (like out testSetup.js) to run before testing

and finally tell it what files to look for (in regex form)



As mocha does not come with an assertion library, we need to include one in our tests.

In these examples will be using chai's expect style
